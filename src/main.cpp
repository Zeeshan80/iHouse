/*  
   Task description: iHouse (SmartHus)
   In this assignment you will create a control system for a smart home, as well as simulate the use of this system.
   It is up to the project team to create a detailed specification of the task. 
   Possible things to create in the system are:
        - Add room
        - Light (off / on / dim / light meter outside / inside)
        - Heat
        - Door locks
        - Home Appliances
        - Alarms / Automatic coffee in the morning
        - Tracking whether there are people in a room.
    The system should be implemented using threads.
    One possible extension is to create a simple graphical user interface.
    It is important that the work with a graphical user interface does not go
    beyond the function of the system (does not become the main part of the task)
